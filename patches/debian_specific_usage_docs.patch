 There are two ways to use ccache\&. You can either prefix your compilation commands with \fBccache\fR or you can create a symbolic link (named as your compiler) to ccache\&. The first method is most convenient if you just want to try out ccache or wish to use it for some specific projects\&. The second method is most useful for when you wish to use ccache for all your compilations\&.
 .sp
-To install for usage by the first method just make sure \fBccache\fR is in your path\&.
+To use the second method on a Debian system, it's easiest to just prepend \fI/usr/lib/ccache\fR to your \fBPATH\fR\&. \fI/usr/lib/ccache\fR contains symlinks for all compilers currently installed as Debian packages\&.
